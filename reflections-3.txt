When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Storing the work in a remote repository will store it in the cloud. In case anything happens to your local, since the remote has all the code, it will remain safe. Also allows large files that may exceed the storage capacity of the local to be stored elsewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case you are working on a file on your local which has also been worked on by another contributor in a commit, there would be a conflict. It gives us more flexibility and control to pull changes made to a remote manually to avoid mismatches in commits. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
