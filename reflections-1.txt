Lesson 1
Q What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros of manual commits:
	you are more in control of the changes you make.
	in case of successive small commits, it becomes very hard to trace errors- this is an issue with Google Docs 

	Cons of manual commits:
	forgetfulness may cause issues 

Q Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	version control works on projects containing multiple files which are dependent on each other

	Google Docs usually just has one file which one can work on independently

Q How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log shows history of when commits were made, 
	git diff shows the actual change in code between commits

Q How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	you can always revert back to a bug free version. taking risks and potentially breaking code isn't scary with version control

Q Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	Adding new files
